    <p>
      General examples for Fuego Core utilities.  This package
      contains some example applications for the general utilities of
      the {@link fuegocore.util} package.  Mostly these demonstrate
      the use of the comprehensive systems contained in subpackages of
      this package, since the main utility classes should be pretty
      self-contained and understandable from their API documentation.
