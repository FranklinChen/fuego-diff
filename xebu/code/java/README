The Java code directory for Fuego Core: usage instructions

For compiling Java code Ant is used.  The build.xml file contains the
Ant rules.  The default target is 'compile', which builds the class
files into =build/classes and assembles jars into =build/lib.  Javadocs
can be extracted into docs/=api with the 'javadoc' target.  'clean'
will delete both the =build and docs/=api directories.

List of ant targets:
compile     default, compile classes
clean       remove class files
javadoc     build javadoc

The directory src contains the Java sources.  The root package is
named fuegocore; appropriate subpackages exist under this.  The
fuegocore.util package is intended for project-wide but -specific
things.

There are also targets for building FCME, the version of Fuego Core
running on top of Java MIDP.  The main targets for FCME are 'me'
for building, 'me-run' for running the compiled code under a
phone emulator, and 'me-doc' for building the API documentation.
The JAR file built is installed in =build/lib along with its JAD file,
and the API documentation into docs/=me-api.

The root package of FCME is named fcme under the src directory.  As
with the normal classes, appropriate subpackages exist under this
directory.  Any midlets live under an appropriate subpackage in
the fcme.examples package.  Any JAR files used from the contrib
directory need to be added to the 'me-obfuscate' target in the manner
of the existing ones.
