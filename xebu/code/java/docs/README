This directory is intended for all sorts of Java-code-related
documentation.  Any API documentation built from the Java code will be
built here.  There are also package-list files used in building API
documentation to get working links to external classes.

The package-list files are stored under the lists directory.  For each
external package that is linked to in documentation comments, there
exists a subdirectory under lists containing the package-list
file from that package.

Other documentation is:
event-admin.txt: Instructions for Web management of the event system
event-ticker-me.txt: Instructions for the Mobile Ticker FCME demo
fcme.txt: Instructions on writing code for FCME
