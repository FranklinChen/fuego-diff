    <p>
      The root package for the FCME side of the messaging system.
      This package is mostly to provide a hierarchy so that the
      messaging subsystem is compartmentalized into its own section of
      the directory hierarchy.  However, it also collects the classes
      that may be used by the users of the messaging system as a
      simpler interface to the specific components.
