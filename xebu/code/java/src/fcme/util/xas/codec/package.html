    <p>
      Default content codecs for XAS.  This package contains the
      default typed content encoders and decoders that are
      automatically registered in the system.  This is FCME-specific,
      since in the normal classes each of these codecs is done as
      separate classes, which would be too wasteful on J2ME.
