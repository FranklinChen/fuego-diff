    <p>
      The root package for the messaging system.  This package is
      mostly to provide a hierarchy so that the messaging subsystem is
      compartmentalized into its own section of the directory
      hierarchy.  However, it also collects the classes that may be
      used by the users of the messaging system as a simpler interface
      to the specific components.
