    <p>
      Utilities for handling XML in programs.  This package contains a
      generic event-sequence-based framework for programmatic use of
      XML.  The intent is to support transparently through the same
      interfaces both reading and writing XML Infoset documents,
      regardless of how they are encoded as byte sequences.
    </p>

    <p>
      The underlying interfaces that the framework expects are the
      XmlPull <code>org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParser</code> for input and
      <code>org.xmlpull.v1.XmlSerializer</code> for output.  These
      interfaces need to be implemented by new serialization formats.
    </p>

    <p>
      In actuality the output interface to implement is an extension
      of the XmlPull one, {@link fuegocore.util.xas.TypedXmlSerializer},
      which provides a method for outputting typed content.  The
      corresponding view on the parsing side is asymmetrically the
      {@link fuegocore.util.xas.TypedEventStream}.  The best example
      source of using this feature is in the XAS unit test class
      {@link fuegocore.util.tests.XasTest}.
