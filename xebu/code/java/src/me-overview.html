    <p>
      This document contains the full API documentation of the
      J2ME-specific parts of the Fuego Core Micro Edition Middleware
      Service Set.  Classes that are documented here either use some
      J2ME-specific functionality or are stripped-down versions of
      standard Fuego Core classes.  The full Fuego Core Micro Edition
      distribution also contains classes from the standard Fuego Core
      Middleware Service Set.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with the standard Fuego Core Middleware Service Set, the
      specification and the implementation documentation of these
      classes are provided in Fuego Core deliverables.
